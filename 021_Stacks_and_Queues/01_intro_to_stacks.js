//what is a stack?
//data collection
//abstract DS
//LIFO
    // Last In First Out
    //Last element added to the stack will be the first element removed
//Think about a stack of plates
    //last plate added if first one cleaned
//queue is FIFO

//how we'll visualize a stack
//a series of nodes

//     Last     size = 4    First
//       ______________________
//      |                     |
// <--[10] <--[2] <--[22] <--[7]
//10 is the last element added and first out

//we see the call stack in recursion 
// where are stacks used
    // managing function invocations 
    //undo/redo functionality 
    //Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack
        //react router 
    //trees and graphs
